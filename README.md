# Data Visualization App

This project leverages any local LLM model, Python, and LangGraph to convert natural language queries into SQL queries and visualize the results with graphs.
## Development

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the git hook to run the linter automatically:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

This uses flake8 with the configuration in `.flake8`.
